# First success on my own dataset

I have been able to create a classifier for classifying the images in my phone into spam ( messages forwarded in whatsapp) and personal photos. I leveraged the pre-built neural networks from the PyTorch TorchVision model library. Made use of the notebooks provided by Daniel Bourke for implementing this project.

This project helped me to learn the following: 

- How to get the weights from an existing neural network 
- How to freeze the existing weights for that part of the network that need not be changed 
- How to modify the head of the neural network 
- Steps to integrate Tensor Boards into the ML monitoring process 
- Compare performance of multiple models 

Now am working on implementing a project to identify and segment subjects in a given image. I now need to decide whether I need to make use of opencv or continue to make use of TorchVision for this purpose. I will try to leverage the code I already have for this purpose.
