# My new gaming laptop

I bought a new nvidia laptop with 4060. Initially the laptop was not supporting integration with the PyTorch library. I spent some time researching to find out how the nvidia graphics card work. 

There are three layers of abstraction (just the software part of it - in the increasing order):

- Layer 1 - nvidia driver software
- Layer 2 - CUDA toolkit
- Layer 3 - PyTorch

Initially I thought the issue was with CUDA and was trying to re-install it. Later I installed the latest version of the nvidia driver and reinstalled PyTorch (which had the CUDA toolkit in-built). 

I created and ran my first deep learning model for classifying images into two categories. I have taken the OxfordIIIT Pet dataset for doing my experiments. 

When I got struck with this issue; it was Daniel Bourke who helped me to figure out the core issue.
