# Continuation of my deep learning journey

I tried the Paperspace platform for implementing my deep learning projects; but most of the time the GPUs which come with the monthly paid option was unavailable. 

So I installed Anaconda in my system. But when I tried to install Fast.AI packages; they were failing. I have used Fast.AI locally before - but for some reason it was not working well in setting up PyTorch. 

I ended up learning how to manage environments in Conda. Created a new one specifically for PyTorch. Took me 4 hours. 

Instead of jumping from one learning material to another; I have decided to focus on implementing my first deep learning project using computer vision. 

In my office even though I am an Azure expert; they requested me to work on an OpenSHift project. I ended up learning about this platform ( and the technologies behind it like docker containers) when I implemennted this project. 

I am going to take a similar approach for my deep learning journey. I have learnt enough of all the basics to get my hands dirty.
