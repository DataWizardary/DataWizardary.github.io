# The Beginning

I have a background in data engineering, data visualization and data science ( non deep learning). I work as a Data Architect for a large Fortune 500 organization architecting analytics platforms leveraging Azure data platforms. 

Even though I have a good understanding of machine learning; I did not have in-depth knowledge in deep learning. So - when I came across Fast.AI in November, 2022 I decided to pursue the course and complete it. But I was not able to comprehend the materials beyond chapter 4. I understood that the core issue was I did not have the fundamental knowledge required to understand deep learning - differential calculus and algorithms. 

I cam across the book - Visual Deep learning in one of the forumns in Fast.AI. I got the book and spent the Christmas holidays of 2022 as well as January 2023 to learn the above mentioned topics. 

I understood that Fast.AI packages are one level of abstraction over PyTorch. So I decided to learn PyTorch first. I came across an excellent course - learnpytorch.io. I completed the first 4 modules of this course using Paperspace runtime environment. This improved my hands on skills and my confidence. 

I am planning to complete all the modules of learnpytorch.io before proceeding further with anything else. 

The hands on project I am planning to complete is a deep learning model to classify the images in my phone into junk ( whatsapp/ redundant images) and useful images.
